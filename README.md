# Unplugged-medicines-control

This repository contains a IFSC module project of semester of 2022/2. The system was designed as a mobile application for elderly people that performs several functions, such as registering new users, registering medications and the time to take them, registering appointments, registering medical evaluations of these appointments, and a button to call the emergency services if necessary. The current version of this project is still in the MVP stage and will still undergo changes, such as changing the native language from Java to Flutter.
